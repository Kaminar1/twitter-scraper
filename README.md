# twitter-scraper

[ ] Go through all videos in the database  
[ ] Fetch tweets (for this time period?) on a 'timeline'  
[ ] Group tweets with videos that are posted in a set timeframe?  
[ ] filter out tweets based on filter config:

- has image
- has at least one from a set of hastags
- has at least one from a set of words/terms
- a "reply" has link to the twitch?
- has an exact matching phrase from a Set

As this might take a while to make 100% correct guesses linked to a `vod_id` in the database, make a backup solution in React to manually link with "best guesses".

Split into two parts:

- Find tweets based on a filter, and save them to the database.
- Go through the database and find matches from vod coll and tweets coll

Example of 2 _tweet-objects_ where the first is the reply to the second, only containing link to twitch (in `text` field).
